       Built environments are where humans have fundamentally transformed landscapes 
      such as urban settings and agricultural land conversion, the natural environment 
      is greatly changed into a simplified human environment. Even acts which seem less
       extreme, such as building a mud hut or a photovoltaic system in the desert, 
      the modified environment becomes an artificial one. Though many animals build
       things to provide a better environment for themselves, they are not human, 
      hence beaver dams, and the works of mound-building termites, are thought of as natural.

       humanity in the Anthropocene have fundamentally effected all natural environments:
       including from climate change, biodiversity loss and pollution from plastic and other

       or components of an environment, and see that their degree of naturalness is not uniform.

       portion of the hydrosphere, as well as the pedosphere (to soil) as an active 
      and intermixed sphere. Earth science (also known as geoscience, the geographical 
      sciences or the Earth Sciences), is an all-embracing term for the sciences related to
       the planet Earth.[4] There are four major disciplines in earth sciences, namely geography,
       geology, geophysics and geodesy. These major disciplines use physics, chemistry, biology, 
      chronology and mathematics to build a qualitative and quantitative understanding of the principal
       areas or spheres of Earth.
